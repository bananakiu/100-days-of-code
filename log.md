# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: September 3, 2018 - Monday
**Time Spent**: 2 hrs 45 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - made a simple webpage declaring Lebron James as the GOAT with hyperlinks, images, etc.

**Thoughts**: I find it appropriate going back to the very basics to start off my 100 day coding challenge. Colt Steele's course, so far, has been amazing, because he goes beyond the coding process and explains the rationale behind some concepts like "semantic markup." Though, I personally have to focus more and eliminate distractions while doing this daily challenge. I have to make that 1 hr+ time sacred!

### Day 2: September 4, 2018 - Tuesday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: 1/2 of Intermediate HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - played with HTML tables, forms, and validations.

**Thoughts**: Pretty cool and simple stuff so far! Can't wait to really dive into the back-end a few weeks from now and really capitalize on input validation, forms, and logins and stuff. Really can't wait to be able to make my own website! Maybe I can make some simple website for my family to track random shiz! Could be a fun little project.

### Day 3: September 5, 2018 - Wednesday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished Intermediate HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - did Colt Steele's quiz for this unit; started with CSS Basics (high-level overview stuff)

**Thoughts**: It took me like 30+ mins to finish the quiz.. a lot longer than I expected. I guess I might have to really put in more time if I want to progress faster. But hey, I love the 3-day consistency I've been having lately. Really excited to dive into CSS now! Time to make these pages look alive!

### Day 4: September 6, 2018 - Thursday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - learned about linking CSS files, about using ID, class, and element selectors.

**Thoughts**: Ugly AF page, but I'm finally starting my CSS studies! Really excited to study DESIGN as well.. color palettes, color theory, UX design principles, etc.

### Day 5: September 7, 2018 - Friday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy). Very simple pages, but difficult underlying concepts. Learned about more intricate CSS selectors  (adjacent, nth-of-type, etc.) and the concept of CSS inheritance and specificity. About to do the the unit test to end the unit! Excited to really apply what I've learned and really absorb all of this.


**Thoughts**: Wow, with these additional selectors and the concept of specifity, I can see CSS being a level more difficult already. I hope that the spaced out learning I have (basically this challenge) will help me absorb all the concepts and good practices well.

### Day 6: September 8, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy). Spent all my time today finishing the final assessment for Introduction to CSS. Synthesised my knowledge and understanding of various selectors and attributes so far and learned about pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I have a much better handle on selectors now that I finished that quiz with ease. Really excited to get into the harder CSS stuff and to finally start making real, beautiful CSS pages/projects.

### Day 7: September 9, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Started the unit on Intermediate CSS. I learned a lot about fonts and the famous box model. Learning about these will really definitely expand what I can do with Web Development. Also worked with Google Fonts, which excited me, because you know.. Google!

**Thoughts**: I was fairly simple today, though I can see myself needing to check out MDN more often for all the attributes related to fonts and box-model related stuff.

### Day 8: September 10, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Made a Tic Tac Toe board with just HTML and CSS. Also started on an instagram-like photo blog website, which I'll finish tomorrow! Learned about how you can apply filters to images (e.g. grayscale) on CSS! AMAZING.

**Thoughts**: Extremely excited for tomorrow's code session, because I'll finally be able to work on a legitimate-looking website. It was quite fun doing the tic tac toe board challenge as well, finally personalizing it, instead of just trying to copy exactly how it looks from the Udemy course. Lots of fun today! I'm hyped up. On a personal note though, I have to stop oversleeping, so that I can code for longer periods of time, instead of having to stop in order to get to my day job on time.

### Day 9: September 11, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: With the help of Colt Steel's Intermediate CSS unit, I'm finally building my own photogrid/ig website. Didn’t finish though, cuz I’m having trouble cropping photos with just CSS! Might take 1 more day to finish this project. I learned about how the float attribute worked in css. I also had some practice with how to apply box model ideas (margin, border, padding).

**Thoughts**: This is pretty tough. The code-along in the online course is pretty easy, but my version of the challenge is a little bit harder. I added non-square pictures of my own (from my Instagram feed actually) in order to have a more "customized" website. Because of this, I'm really learning more (styling and modifying images) with CSS, but also having a much harder time. I might check out an Instagram profile's CSS source code for ideas if it isn't too verbose.

### Day 10: September 12, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 30 mins

**Today's Progress**: Spent the entire time debugging my code from yesterday. The overflow and display attributes saved my life today! It's not perfect, but I feel like I've done all that I can with CSS for this scenario, since my intuition tells me I'd need javascript to dynamically select which attribute (height or width) to set to 100% (depending on if the photo is portait or landscape) in order to get ALL images, regardless of dimension to fit in a square. 

**Thoughts**: While I was frustrated early on, I had so much fun experimenting and just being a programmer today (debugging and Googling fixes online). It was literally at the 55th minute where I had some insight as to what would work (the overflow attribute), and then I was on my way. So excited to end the unit with another exercise like this one tomorrow! JAVASCRIPT, HERE I COME!
