### Day 1: September 3, 2018 - Monday
**Time Spent**: 2 hrs 45 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - made a simple webpage declaring Lebron James as the GOAT with hyperlinks, images, etc.

**Thoughts**: I find it appropriate going back to the very basics to start off my 100 day coding challenge. Colt Steele's course, so far, has been amazing, because he goes beyond the coding process and explains the rationale behind some concepts like "semantic markup." Though, I personally have to focus more and eliminate distractions while doing this daily challenge. I have to make that 1 hr+ time sacred!

### Day 2: September 4, 2018 - Tuesday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: 1/2 of Intermediate HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - played with HTML tables, forms, and validations.

**Thoughts**: Pretty cool and simple stuff so far! Can't wait to really dive into the back-end a few weeks from now and really capitalize on input validation, forms, and logins and stuff. Really can't wait to be able to make my own website! Maybe I can make some simple website for my family to track random shiz! Could be a fun little project.

### Day 3: September 5, 2018 - Wednesday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished Intermediate HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - did Colt Steele's quiz for this unit; started with CSS Basics (high-level overview stuff)

**Thoughts**: It took me like 30+ mins to finish the quiz.. a lot longer than I expected. I guess I might have to really put in more time if I want to progress faster. But hey, I love the 3-day consistency I've been having lately. Really excited to dive into CSS now! Time to make these pages look alive!

### Day 4: September 6, 2018 - Thursday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - learned about linking CSS files, about using ID, class, and element selectors.

**Thoughts**: Ugly AF page, but I'm finally starting my CSS studies! Really excited to study DESIGN as well.. color palettes, color theory, UX design principles, etc.

### Day 5: September 7, 2018 - Friday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy). Very simple pages, but difficult underlying concepts. Learned about more intricate CSS selectors  (adjacent, nth-of-type, etc.) and the concept of CSS inheritance and specificity. About to do the the unit test to end the unit! Excited to really apply what I've learned and really absorb all of this.


**Thoughts**: Wow, with these additional selectors and the concept of specifity, I can see CSS being a level more difficult already. I hope that the spaced out learning I have (basically this challenge) will help me absorb all the concepts and good practices well.

### Day 6: September 8, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy). Spent all my time today finishing the final assessment for Introduction to CSS. Synthesised my knowledge and understanding of various selectors and attributes so far and learned about pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I have a much better handle on selectors now that I finished that quiz with ease. Really excited to get into the harder CSS stuff and to finally start making real, beautiful CSS pages/projects.

### Day 7: September 9, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Started the unit on Intermediate CSS. I learned a lot about fonts and the famous box model. Learning about these will really definitely expand what I can do with Web Development. Also worked with Google Fonts, which excited me, because you know.. Google!

**Thoughts**: I was fairly simple today, though I can see myself needing to check out MDN more often for all the attributes related to fonts and box-model related stuff.

### Day 8: September 10, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Made a Tic Tac Toe board with just HTML and CSS. Also started on an instagram-like photo blog website, which I'll finish tomorrow! Learned about how you can apply filters to images (e.g. grayscale) on CSS! AMAZING.

**Thoughts**: Extremely excited for tomorrow's code session, because I'll finally be able to work on a legitimate-looking website. It was quite fun doing the tic tac toe board challenge as well, finally personalizing it, instead of just trying to copy exactly how it looks from the Udemy course. Lots of fun today! I'm hyped up. On a personal note though, I have to stop oversleeping, so that I can code for longer periods of time, instead of having to stop in order to get to my day job on time.

### Day 9: September 11, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: With the help of Colt Steel's Intermediate CSS unit, I'm finally building my own photogrid/ig website. Didn’t finish though, cuz I’m having trouble cropping photos with just CSS! Might take 1 more day to finish this project. I learned about how the float attribute worked in css. I also had some practice with how to apply box model ideas (margin, border, padding).

**Thoughts**: This is pretty tough. The code-along in the online course is pretty easy, but my version of the challenge is a little bit harder. I added non-square pictures of my own (from my Instagram feed actually) in order to have a more "customized" website. Because of this, I'm really learning more (styling and modifying images) with CSS, but also having a much harder time. I might check out an Instagram profile's CSS source code for ideas if it isn't too verbose.

### Day 10: September 12, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 30 mins

**Today's Progress**: Spent the entire time debugging my code from yesterday. The overflow and display attributes saved my life today! It's not perfect, but I feel like I've done all that I can with CSS for this scenario, since my intuition tells me I'd need javascript to dynamically select which attribute (height or width) to set to 100% (depending on if the photo is portait or landscape) in order to get ALL images, regardless of dimension to fit in a square. 

**Thoughts**: While I was frustrated early on, I had so much fun experimenting and just being a programmer today (debugging and Googling fixes online). It was literally at the 55th minute where I had some insight as to what would work (the overflow attribute), and then I was on my way. So excited to end the unit with another exercise like this one tomorrow! JAVASCRIPT, HERE I COME!

### Day 11: September 13, 2018 - Thursday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the unit on Intermediate CSS. Did the final unit exercise which involved making a simple blogging page with Lorem Ipsum text, which was pretty fun and straightforward. I also used an online color picker, but upon discovering my need for a dropper tool, I quickly got a Chrome Extension which has a dropper tool I can use on any page to provide me with the hexcode of any color (it also has a color picker built-in)!

**Thoughts**: I didn't learn much today, but I was able to synthesize everything I've learned so far in this interesting module. I feel like the box model really comes naturally to me now at this point, so that's just amazing. I use an "M&M" analogy to remember the terminology of the box model, as weird as it sounds. The padding represents the chocolate inside; the border represents the sugar coated border which shield the chocolate of the M&M; and very conveniently, the margin is the "m" on the M&M logo which is on the sugar coated border. In other news, I am very excited to use javascript and do some /actual/ programming!

### Day 12: September 14, 2018 - Friday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Bootstrap for CSS and it was pretty amazing! It's another layer of abstraction, but it made building basic responive websites so much faster and user-friendly. I didn't do so much unsupervised learning (not in the machine learning sense LOL), but I was able to pick up on a lot of basics thanks to Colt Steele's Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: Wow, that was pretty fun. I guess I understand how web developers can build websites so fast now. Frameworks and libraries (much like in Python), really enhance the experience of coding, making it a lot less verbose and unecessarily taxing. I guess seeing myself as a web developer is a little more believable after finding out about Bootstrap. I'm EXTREMELY far from being even close to a full-stack developer though. I'm excited to learn more about Bootstrap (and Javascript later on).

### Day 13: September 15, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Bootstrap nav-bars and the studied the grid system today. It was pretty difficult! I had some problems w/ the version of Bootstrap as well, because the Udemy course I'm taking uses Bootstrap 3, but I went ahead and used Bootstrap 4 at first.

**Thoughts**: Upon finding out about the recency of the release of Bootstrap 4 though, I decided to just learn CSS and JS Bootstrap with Bootstrap 3. I'll just checkout migration tutorials and changes in documentation when I finish the course. I hope I don't regret that decision. I had a really hard time today! Really hope the unit exercise is hard enough to help me synthesize all of this! So excited for Javascript, but I feel like I really need to establish some degree of mastery (or at the very least, comfort) with Bootstrap first.

### Day 14: September 16, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 15 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about the inner workings of the grid system. Built a photo grid yet again, but with more features (it's scalable thanks to Bootstrap)! 

**Thoughts**: It wasn't too challenging today, but nonetheless, it was full of learning. I finally got to synthesize what I knew from Bootstrap so far, and it was really fun creating something that looked pretty good too. I have to debug a part of the code tomorrow though, which involves unevenly sized images again. much like the first photogrid.

### Day 15: September 17, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Retouched the photo gallery website I did yesterday for the Udemy course I'm taking. Started with the Startup Landing page code-along using my own startup idea from back in 2015 (similar idea to https://hangtimeapp.com/).

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty cool! I got introduced to even more resources like Font Awesome. I guess it just goes to show that part of being a good web developer is being exposed to or finding the right resources as well to make efficient/bearable workflow a lot more feasible. Ending Bootstrap tomorrow, so I'm excited to find out more about Javascript when I watch the intro!

### Day 16: September 18, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the startup landing page for my old startup idea, MeetApp (props to my dad for that name). I'm done with the Bootstrap module and am now starting with Javascript!

**Thoughts**: I feel I have a lot more confidence with Bootstrap now. Javascript also started out pretty easy. Having a strong background with Python helps, as Javascript seems like it's closer to the structure of most programming languages out there that I've been exposed to (Java, C, Python, Swift, etc.)

### Day 17: September 19, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Did 3 exercises on Javascript today: an age calculator, a website that says your name back, and one that just says "hi." Still doing pretty basic stuff right now, but I guess it's important not to skip this, because it's good to have great foundations when learning a new language.

**Thoughts**: Nothing pretty spectacular is going on right now, because it's still the basics. I find it a little slow too right now, because I have a background in Python. This means the next 2-3 units will be pretty chill too. I guess it's just time to relax for now and pay attention to any tips, tricks, and shortcuts in the meantime.

### Day 18: September 20, 2018 - Thursday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple Javascript number guessing game with alerts, prompts, etc., and built a simple Javascript page that checks out properties about your age. Learned about Javascript logical operators and conditionals today.

**Thoughts**: I guess this is the day I remember how important it is to slow down and really listen even during the basics. This is because while I do have some solid knowledge on logical operators and conditionals in general already, Javascript has these special nuances (e.g. the use of "===", "==" being less strict, and truthy and falsy values). It was simple and fun today! Hopefully, the next few days will be a little more challenging.

### Day 19: September 21, 2018 - Friday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Javascript control flows today. Specifically, I got to learn the syntax for while loops in Javascript. Got to do a lot of exercises as well, solidifying my knowledge on logical operators, conditionals, and while loops.

**Thoughts**: Nothing logically challenging, as I've been through this via Python before, but it's still nice to get aclimated with a new language's way of doing things. I'm getting a little impatient, but it might simply be because of the lack of substantial and concrete output. Just gotta remind myself the fundamentals are just as important!

### Day 20: September 22, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 15 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the module on Javascript control flows with exercises on For Loops. Learned a lot about JS functions and did a couple of exercises on those too.

**Thoughts**: I got to learn a lot about the syntax for For Loops and Functions, which are honestly pretty similar across languages. Learned a couple of nuances about Javascript as well, like how functions called with incomplete parameters still run (empty parameters become equal to undefined).

### Day 21: September 23, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the module on JS functions and started with the one on arrays. I built a simple to-do list app on the chrome browser. It's nothing fancy, but it's exciting to finally building something with some functionality.

**Thoughts**: It's always nice to learn slicing and indexing in languages. It's also very convenient that it is very similar with Python, which I have some level of mastery with. I think I'll be done with Javascript basics in about 2-3 more days. After that, I'll be studying DOM-related stuff, whatever that is.

### Day 22: September 24, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned about array iteration in Javascript, and found out about forEach, a method that's new to me. Using these, I upgraded my To Do List app for more functionality and readability.

**Thoughts**: Excited to finish up Javascript basics to be honest. It might be because of the lack of the satisfaction of completing a nice-looking project. But I guess I have to remind myself that I can't rush this. Things like forEach are what I wouldn't have learned if I didn't take things slow. The grind continues..

### Day 23: September 25, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Did a problem set to summarize my understanding on Javascript arrays so far. Also learned a lot of background information about Javascript objects as well. I'll be finished with the Arrays unit and maybe half of the Objects unit by tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Today's exercises were challenging enough for me to learn and not be frustrated. Also, in terms of doing this challenge, today was the hardest to do, because we visited our boss in the morning in the hospital, because he got dengue over the weekend. I guess the best approach is to really wake up early for the purpose of completing the challenge first thing in the morning. I'll take that approach next time.

### Day 24: September 26, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the unit on JS Arrays by deconstructing and rebuilding the ForEach function. Also played with JSON structures by making my own movieDB for this Javascript Objects exercise Colt Steele gave. I'm really close to finishing the unit on JS Objects, so I'm pretty much done with Javascript Basics!

**Thoughts**: It was fun to play around with the JSON file type. I can finally tell myself that isn't a foreign word to me anymore. I'm also excited to move on to more backend related stuff tomorrow (I'm assuming DOM is part of backend).

### Day 25: September 27, 2018 - Thursday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished Javascript Basics and learned about objects and the "this" keyword. I'm finally in the DOM unit, so JS, CSS, and HTML are coming together! I made a basic html file that changes background color every second. 

**Thoughts**: So excited to finally make stuff again! DOM is basically the intersection of HTML, CSS, and JS, so thisi s basically what I've been waiting to do for so long! So hyped up!!

### Day 26: September 28, 2018 - Friday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Not much coding today. Instead, I studied a lot of DOM selection and manipulation (specifically style and text manipulation).

**Thoughts**: Some things fascinated me, like how Javascript can toggle classes instead of individual styles on HTML tags, which adheres to the important concept of separation of concerns. I know I keep saying this, but it's getting really exciting! Can't wait to build my own website and another for my dad's company!

### Day 27: September 29, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Used Javascript to change Google's logo to Runescape's logo. Also redirected all links in the webpage to go to https://runescape.com. It's one of my favorite games! HAHA. Finished the module on DOM Manipulation and started with Advanced DOM Manipulation.

**Thoughts**: The module on DOM Manipulation really opened my eyes to the possibilities of web development and made it feel a little more feasible/doable for me. I'm really excited about the Advanced DOM Manipulation module as well, since we're already dealing with event listeners!

### Day 28: September 30, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to add event listeners to buttons so that users themselves can modify things dynamically on a webpage. I'm currently in the middle of completing a simple score keeper app, which I'm going to be finishing up tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I tried to do the code-along by myself first before watching the video, which significantly improve my learning speed. I'm going to do this more often moving forward.

### Day 29: October 01, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the module on advanced DOM manipulation with a couple of exercises: an interactive to-do list that has events happening upon hovering and clicking and a scorekeeper web app that can keep track of the scores of 2 players playing against each other in a turn-based manner.

**Thoughts**: I think the exercises to end the module were pretty solid! I feel very comfortable with what I know, and I think I can accomplish a lot with the skillset I have at this point. There is still SO MUCH to learn though. The grind continues.

### Day 30: October 02, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Started with a new unit called the "Color Game Project" which is a project aimed at synthesizing all I've learned about DOM manipulation, Javascript, HTML, and CSS so far.

**Thoughts**: I'll probably spend the next 2-3 days finishing this up. I did some coding while doing other things like preparing breakfast, which really threw my focus off and affected my "learning rate," so that's something I should avoid next time.

### Day 31: October 03, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Continued my progress with the color game project. I added a reset/play again button, a game mode button (hard/easy), and programmed logic into the game.

**Thoughts**: Lots of fun today, programming logic into the game! I guess this is what I've always wanted to do, even back as an app enthusiast. It's just easier and faster to do in web development than app development, at least in comparison to the short stint I had as an Android app developer for 2-3 weeks.

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the color game project, which was amazing! It's a fully functional and decent looking game. It's actually pretty fun to play too! I'm doing jQuery next, which is exciting, because I had a taste of transitions today.

**Thoughts**: I might actually place this in my portfolio, but I'm still not sure if I should, because it's the product of a code-along. Anyway, at this point, I'm already thinking of what to put on my web development portfolio in the future. One would be a website for my dad's textile company, another might be a web app for this startup idea I got just earlier this week, and many more I have yet to think of.

### Day 33: October 05, 2018 - Friday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Started with jQuery today! Been learning how it works vs. vanilla JS conceptually and in code. Also, programmed a shortcut to open HTML files directly from Sublime Text (got it from here: https://www.michaelcrump.net/getting-sublime-3-to-launch-your-html-page-in-a-browser-with-a-key-combo).

**Thoughts**: I was honestly doing fine with vanilla JS DOM Manipulation, but wow, jQuery makes it so much cleaner, faster, and more fun to do these things. Really excited to learn this to speed up some coding before I move on to actual larger-scale projects! The keyboard shortcut for opening HTML files directly from Sublime Text that I programmed today will save me a ton of time as well! Neat stuff.

### Day 34: October 06, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Did my first exercise on jQuery selectors. Learned a lot about very different methods in jQuery, thus my mishmash of code for this week. Finished the unit on the Intro to jQuery, so I'm moving on to Advanced jQuery starting tomorrow, which will likely last for 1-2 days. 

**Thoughts**: I'm about 5 days away from backend, so it's really time to solidify the frontend knowledge I have. Reviewing it all in jQuery isn't half bad either! This 100 days of code thing is amazing. I really feel like I never have an unproductive day anymore, plus I actually move towards a concrete goal I have: become a web developer.

### Day 35: October 07, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished Advanced jQuery today in Colt Steel's Udemy course. Learned about jQuery events and effects and tested them all out! Pretty fun today today, because I got to see how simple it is to add basic events like fading and sliding.

**Thoughts**: Finally done with basic knowledge on jQuery! Really excited to do that nice To-do List project for the next 2 days or so. Can't wait to get back to creating things!

### Day 36: October 08, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Made a functional to-do list webapp that can strike through finished tasks and delete them as well. Also did some of the styling, but I'm not yet done. Will surely finish by tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Always fun to be working on a concrete project! Did this hour of code after midnight, which is a first, so I won't be coding when I wake up tomorrow morning. Instead, I'll be helping my mom get ready to leave for the airport (she visited me throughout this weekend). Gotta get used to stuff like this if I wanna be consistent with my coding practice. There will be days I wake up at dawn to code as well, I'm sure.

### Day 37: October 09, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished styling my todo list app, which you can checkout here: https://codepen.io/leandre-kiu/pen/EdZXBQ! Was really able to synthesize a lot of my learning so far, and it's been amazing!

**Thoughts**: Considering switching to codepen fully for my code sharing, because users will be able to checkout and interact with my projects. Also, because Codeshare doesn't seem to have a feature where I can seamlessly put codes of different file formats into one page (html, css, js). Really had fun doing the todo list project, and I can't wait to start with the Patatap Clone. Using libraries is always amazing, because it empowers you to be able to do so much more very quickly. Can't wait!

### Day 38: October 10, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time configuring Sublime Text's syntax coloring for paperscript. Also, I learned about Paper JS today and drew some very basic lines and circles.

**Thoughts**: I didn't really get to code much. I did mostly configuring and debugging today, even with the little code I wrote. Kind of a boring day, but seeing all the possibilities of Paper JS excites me.

### Day 39: October 11, 2018 - Thursday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Did more work with Paper JS and Howler JS. Really got a lot of work done for the https://patatap.com/ clone I'm making via Colt Steel's course. 

**Thoughts**: Lots of fun working with shapes, animations, sounds, and really concrete things in general. Really excited to finish this Patatap clone by tomorrow. Also, tomorrow, I'll officially be moving to backend stuff, which I suddenly have mixed feelings about. I personally feel like I still need more concrete practice with frontend stuff, moving to the backend. Maybe after this entire course, I'll do like 5-10 frontend projects, before going full-stack and further developing my backend skills (inclined to learn Django, since I'm a Python geek).

### Day 40: October 12, 2018 - Friday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the patatap.com clone. Done with the fundamentals of Frontend, and now, I officially begin my backend web developer journey! Wish me luck! Learned about stacks and web technologies today.

**Thoughts**: Really excited to start with backend, especially after that lengthy introduction Colt Steel gave. Really interesting to finally learn how websites really work under the hood. I think I'll enjoy backend a lot, especially given my background and inclination towards data science and Python. Also, I'm officially 40% done with #100DaysOfCode!

### Day 41: October 13, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: No code today. Spent the day listening to lectures and understanding how HTTP requests work (used an application called Postman for this). Also, I was able to learn about the basic mechanisms of backend, like the get and post requests, servers, databases, and how they all interact with each other.

**Thoughts**: Was sleepy today, mostly because I started coding earlier (body clock's slowly normalizing again). It was nice and illuminating to find out exactly how dynamic pages get their content and how the server talks to the database, etc. Hope I get more engaged as these things become even more concrete!

### Day 42: October 14, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: No code today. Spent the day setting up my coding environment (Cloud 9) and learning about basic command line commands. I took a while to set up, because I tried to setup the MEAN stack locally, only to realize (after watching Colt's video) that it would be much better (and just as fast) to use Cloud 9.

**Thoughts**: I guess setting up and learning the basics of these things are important. I will employ the same attitude I had with Javascript Basics. I'll get into the exciting stuff in about 2-3 more days I think! Not too long of a wait left hehe.

### Day 43: October 15, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Command Line module today by completing a fun little exercise. Started learning Node JS, my first server-side language. Did a couple of exercises for Node as well. I was also able to learn about Node JS in general, and how it revolutionized backend web development (by allowing JavaScript to be used in the backend).

**Thoughts**: Finally coding again! 2 days of just lecture was pretty interesting and definitely worthwhile, especially because my main disadvantage as a non-CS business major is my lack of a strong conceptual foundation, but it was definitely fun being coding again! Excited for what else Node JS has to offer (I can't stop thinking of it as a temporary language though, because I plan on learning Django and React in the future).

### Day 44: October 16, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned about NPM today, which is pretty powerful. I learned how to basically import JS libraries/packages into the backend, which makes the possibilities for this endless! Imported cat-me, knock-knock-jokes, and an actual useful package called faker, which creates fake data. I did a couple of exercises on these to solidify my knowledge, which I feel worked.

**Thoughts**: I can draw parallels with Python here and conda/pip, which just further reinforces my view of JavaScript as something truly powerful. I'm really excited to learn about more popular and useful packages to really quickly expand my ability to create things. Personally, it was really difficult to get my #100DaysOfCode done today, because of my irregular work shift for the day. Went in the office really early, because of a team activity, so I wasn't able to do my work early in the morning. I guess this is why the "CEO schedule" really works; by waking up so early, you get so much productive work done in the morning, such that everything else that happens after it is just icing on the cake. Pretty amazing realization.. that will likely be something I'll be working towards in the future.

### Day 45: October 17, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the module on Node.JS, and started learning Express JS. Learned the difference between libraries and frameworks as well. I was able to build my first Express application as well, so I was able to learn some basics on routes and calling libraries/frameworks with the require() function.

**Thoughts**: Was pretty unengaged today, because my I'm really just having a really busy week at work today. I guess this is the reality of life. It's just difficult to balance work, personal goals, and leisure at the same time. Today was pretty interesting though! The code-alongs felt more concrete and enlightening, because of the all the explanations Colt had to give about frameworks, server-side stuff, etc.

### Day 46: October 18, 2018 - Thursday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 15 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Introduction to Express JS module by completing a pretty elaborate exercise on routing. Took me longer than usual, but I definitely had a lot of fun synthesizing everything I knew so far about routing.

**Thoughts**: Things are becoming more concrete for me now, especially because of that exercise. Though, it's still been a challenge to balance this hour of code with my gym and work schedule without compromising one. I have to be more focused when I do my hour of code so that I take just 1 hour instead of 2, like today.

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned about views/templates and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) today, so I'm slowly understanding how dynamic webpages work. Just did code-alongs today.

**Thoughts**: Nothing too fancy today, but it was fun extracting data from the URL and using that to dynamically impact webpages. Excited to do that with Databases in the future.

### Day 48: October 20, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned a lot of important concepts today related to EJS files and Express. I learned about different EJS tags, about html partials, importance of paths, etc.

**Thoughts**: Pretty insightful day today, just because of the volume of new concepts learned. I loved how Colt always makes sure to teach use how to make our code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), because it's really something that will be used heavily in practice. It also just helps me ensure I'm writing higher quality code.

### Day 49: October 21, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished Intermediate Express JS today by making a simple app that uses a backend to dynamically update a website's content. Also learned about APIs and their utility.

**Thoughts**: It was fun but messy working with a backend without a database yet, since we had to deal with variable scoping, but I guess it's nice to see how things work in the backend. I'm really excited about the module on APIs, because it's always been a term that I knew about (and knew the power of) without understanding it fully.

### Day 50: October 22, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned more concepts behind APIs, JSON files, and XML files. Got to try out accessing data from Yahoo's Weather API as well to find the sunset in Hawaii.

**Thoughts**: Fun times! APIs are really exciting -- a sentiment I have that I've expressed many times. It's very enlightening understanding how the data that gets sent between apps look like, just so that I have a deeper understanding of what goes on when API requests are made.

### Day 51: October 23, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the module on APIs by constructing a simple Movie Search App via the Open Movie Database API. Started with the course's capstone project as well by watching the introduction to Yelp Camp.

**Thoughts**: This was tons of fun! I think I just have a lot of enthuasiasm when it comes to APIs, because it opens up lots of possible use cases, which excites me as a natural entrepreneurship enthusiast with all these startup ideas running through my head.

### Day 52: October 24, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on the capstone project of the course: YelpCamp. Got a preview of the RESTful routing convention while coding up some GET and POST routes. Also got to practice more on coding up JS code on EJS files.

**Thoughts**: Routing is slowly getting more confusing, especially since I just really coded along without slowing down much, because I woke up late today. I might want to break down the logic of things (e.g. how data gets moved from one page to another, the real differences of GET and POST requests and what those differences imply, etc.).

### Day 53: October 25, 2018 - Thursday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of Bootstrap styling for my YelpCamp project today, so it was a nice little review. At the same time, I learned about databases (SQL vs. noSQL) as well on a conceptual level.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap's pretty difficult, man! Not because of how it's used, but because of the myriad of options avaialble. I feel like I should really either do a lot of Bootstrap projects or take a dedicated Bootstrap online class to really master it. On the flip side, I really enjoyed the lecture on databases today, because it really confirmed a lot of concepts and conclusions I've made in my head throughout my time being exposed to them.

### Day 54: October 26, 2018 - Friday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Spent the whole session just setting up MongoDB in Cloud9 and then playing around with Mongo console commands.

**Thoughts**: Not much happened today. Was generally really distracted, because I had to help out some friends and there was a Lakers game on (huge LeBron fan here), so I had to backtrack a lot, and lost lots of time. I might look into waking up at dawn and then doing my hour of code before sleeping again, just so that I have that sacred time.
