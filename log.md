**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: September 3, 2018 - Monday
**Time Spent**: 2 hrs 45 mins
**Today's Progress**: Introduction to HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - made a simple webpage declaring Lebron James as the GOAT with hyperlinks, images, etc.

**Thoughts**: I find it appropriate going back to the very basics to start off my 100 day coding challenge. Colt Steele's course, so far, has been amazing, because he goes beyond the coding process and explains the rationale behind some concepts like "semantic markup." Though, I personally have to focus more and eliminate distractions while doing this daily challenge. I have to make that 1 hr+ time sacred!

### Day 2: September 4, 2018 - Tuesday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins
**Today's Progress**: 1/2 of Intermediate HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - played with HTML tables, forms, and validations.

**Thoughts**: Pretty cool and simple stuff so far! Can't wait to really dive into the back-end a few weeks from now and really capitalize on input validation, forms, and logins and stuff. Really can't wait to be able to make my own website! Maybe I can make some simple website for my family to track random shiz! Could be a fun little project.

### Day 3: September 5, 2018 - Wednesday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins
**Today's Progress**: Finished Intermediate HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - did Colt Steele's quiz for this unit; started with CSS Basics (high-level overview stuff)

**Thoughts**: It took me like 30+ mins to finish the quiz.. a lot longer than I expected. I guess I might have to really put in more time if I want to progress faster. But hey, I love the 3-day consistency I've been having lately. Really excited to dive into CSS now! Time to make these pages look alive!
