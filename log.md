### Day 1: September 3, 2018 - Monday
**Time Spent**: 2 hrs 45 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - made a simple webpage declaring Lebron James as the GOAT with hyperlinks, images, etc.

**Thoughts**: I find it appropriate going back to the very basics to start off my 100 day coding challenge. Colt Steele's course, so far, has been amazing, because he goes beyond the coding process and explains the rationale behind some concepts like "semantic markup." Though, I personally have to focus more and eliminate distractions while doing this daily challenge. I have to make that 1 hr+ time sacred!

### Day 2: September 4, 2018 - Tuesday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: 1/2 of Intermediate HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - played with HTML tables, forms, and validations.

**Thoughts**: Pretty cool and simple stuff so far! Can't wait to really dive into the back-end a few weeks from now and really capitalize on input validation, forms, and logins and stuff. Really can't wait to be able to make my own website! Maybe I can make some simple website for my family to track random shiz! Could be a fun little project.

### Day 3: September 5, 2018 - Wednesday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished Intermediate HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - did Colt Steele's quiz for this unit; started with CSS Basics (high-level overview stuff)

**Thoughts**: It took me like 30+ mins to finish the quiz.. a lot longer than I expected. I guess I might have to really put in more time if I want to progress faster. But hey, I love the 3-day consistency I've been having lately. Really excited to dive into CSS now! Time to make these pages look alive!

### Day 4: September 6, 2018 - Thursday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - learned about linking CSS files, about using ID, class, and element selectors.

**Thoughts**: Ugly AF page, but I'm finally starting my CSS studies! Really excited to study DESIGN as well.. color palettes, color theory, UX design principles, etc.

### Day 5: September 7, 2018 - Friday
**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy). Very simple pages, but difficult underlying concepts. Learned about more intricate CSS selectors  (adjacent, nth-of-type, etc.) and the concept of CSS inheritance and specificity. About to do the the unit test to end the unit! Excited to really apply what I've learned and really absorb all of this.


**Thoughts**: Wow, with these additional selectors and the concept of specifity, I can see CSS being a level more difficult already. I hope that the spaced out learning I have (basically this challenge) will help me absorb all the concepts and good practices well.

### Day 6: September 8, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to CSS (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy). Spent all my time today finishing the final assessment for Introduction to CSS. Synthesised my knowledge and understanding of various selectors and attributes so far and learned about pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I have a much better handle on selectors now that I finished that quiz with ease. Really excited to get into the harder CSS stuff and to finally start making real, beautiful CSS pages/projects.

### Day 7: September 9, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Started the unit on Intermediate CSS. I learned a lot about fonts and the famous box model. Learning about these will really definitely expand what I can do with Web Development. Also worked with Google Fonts, which excited me, because you know.. Google!

**Thoughts**: I was fairly simple today, though I can see myself needing to check out MDN more often for all the attributes related to fonts and box-model related stuff.

### Day 8: September 10, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Made a Tic Tac Toe board with just HTML and CSS. Also started on an instagram-like photo blog website, which I'll finish tomorrow! Learned about how you can apply filters to images (e.g. grayscale) on CSS! AMAZING.

**Thoughts**: Extremely excited for tomorrow's code session, because I'll finally be able to work on a legitimate-looking website. It was quite fun doing the tic tac toe board challenge as well, finally personalizing it, instead of just trying to copy exactly how it looks from the Udemy course. Lots of fun today! I'm hyped up. On a personal note though, I have to stop oversleeping, so that I can code for longer periods of time, instead of having to stop in order to get to my day job on time.

### Day 9: September 11, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: With the help of Colt Steel's Intermediate CSS unit, I'm finally building my own photogrid/ig website. Didn’t finish though, cuz I’m having trouble cropping photos with just CSS! Might take 1 more day to finish this project. I learned about how the float attribute worked in css. I also had some practice with how to apply box model ideas (margin, border, padding).

**Thoughts**: This is pretty tough. The code-along in the online course is pretty easy, but my version of the challenge is a little bit harder. I added non-square pictures of my own (from my Instagram feed actually) in order to have a more "customized" website. Because of this, I'm really learning more (styling and modifying images) with CSS, but also having a much harder time. I might check out an Instagram profile's CSS source code for ideas if it isn't too verbose.

### Day 10: September 12, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 30 mins

**Today's Progress**: Spent the entire time debugging my code from yesterday. The overflow and display attributes saved my life today! It's not perfect, but I feel like I've done all that I can with CSS for this scenario, since my intuition tells me I'd need javascript to dynamically select which attribute (height or width) to set to 100% (depending on if the photo is portait or landscape) in order to get ALL images, regardless of dimension to fit in a square. 

**Thoughts**: While I was frustrated early on, I had so much fun experimenting and just being a programmer today (debugging and Googling fixes online). It was literally at the 55th minute where I had some insight as to what would work (the overflow attribute), and then I was on my way. So excited to end the unit with another exercise like this one tomorrow! JAVASCRIPT, HERE I COME!

### Day 11: September 13, 2018 - Thursday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the unit on Intermediate CSS. Did the final unit exercise which involved making a simple blogging page with Lorem Ipsum text, which was pretty fun and straightforward. I also used an online color picker, but upon discovering my need for a dropper tool, I quickly got a Chrome Extension which has a dropper tool I can use on any page to provide me with the hexcode of any color (it also has a color picker built-in)!

**Thoughts**: I didn't learn much today, but I was able to synthesize everything I've learned so far in this interesting module. I feel like the box model really comes naturally to me now at this point, so that's just amazing. I use an "M&M" analogy to remember the terminology of the box model, as weird as it sounds. The padding represents the chocolate inside; the border represents the sugar coated border which shield the chocolate of the M&M; and very conveniently, the margin is the "m" on the M&M logo which is on the sugar coated border. In other news, I am very excited to use javascript and do some /actual/ programming!

### Day 12: September 14, 2018 - Friday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Bootstrap for CSS and it was pretty amazing! It's another layer of abstraction, but it made building basic responive websites so much faster and user-friendly. I didn't do so much unsupervised learning (not in the machine learning sense LOL), but I was able to pick up on a lot of basics thanks to Colt Steele's Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: Wow, that was pretty fun. I guess I understand how web developers can build websites so fast now. Frameworks and libraries (much like in Python), really enhance the experience of coding, making it a lot less verbose and unecessarily taxing. I guess seeing myself as a web developer is a little more believable after finding out about Bootstrap. I'm EXTREMELY far from being even close to a full-stack developer though. I'm excited to learn more about Bootstrap (and Javascript later on).

### Day 13: September 15, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Bootstrap nav-bars and the studied the grid system today. It was pretty difficult! I had some problems w/ the version of Bootstrap as well, because the Udemy course I'm taking uses Bootstrap 3, but I went ahead and used Bootstrap 4 at first.

**Thoughts**: Upon finding out about the recency of the release of Bootstrap 4 though, I decided to just learn CSS and JS Bootstrap with Bootstrap 3. I'll just checkout migration tutorials and changes in documentation when I finish the course. I hope I don't regret that decision. I had a really hard time today! Really hope the unit exercise is hard enough to help me synthesize all of this! So excited for Javascript, but I feel like I really need to establish some degree of mastery (or at the very least, comfort) with Bootstrap first.

### Day 14: September 16, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 15 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about the inner workings of the grid system. Built a photo grid yet again, but with more features (it's scalable thanks to Bootstrap)! 

**Thoughts**: It wasn't too challenging today, but nonetheless, it was full of learning. I finally got to synthesize what I knew from Bootstrap so far, and it was really fun creating something that looked pretty good too. I have to debug a part of the code tomorrow though, which involves unevenly sized images again. much like the first photogrid.

### Day 15: September 17, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Retouched the photo gallery website I did yesterday for the Udemy course I'm taking. Started with the Startup Landing page code-along using my own startup idea from back in 2015 (similar idea to https://hangtimeapp.com/).

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty cool! I got introduced to even more resources like Font Awesome. I guess it just goes to show that part of being a good web developer is being exposed to or finding the right resources as well to make efficient/bearable workflow a lot more feasible. Ending Bootstrap tomorrow, so I'm excited to find out more about Javascript when I watch the intro!

### Day 16: September 18, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the startup landing page for my old startup idea, MeetApp (props to my dad for that name). I'm done with the Bootstrap module and am now starting with Javascript!

**Thoughts**: I feel I have a lot more confidence with Bootstrap now. Javascript also started out pretty easy. Having a strong background with Python helps, as Javascript seems like it's closer to the structure of most programming languages out there that I've been exposed to (Java, C, Python, Swift, etc.)

### Day 17: September 19, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Did 3 exercises on Javascript today: an age calculator, a website that says your name back, and one that just says "hi." Still doing pretty basic stuff right now, but I guess it's important not to skip this, because it's good to have great foundations when learning a new language.

**Thoughts**: Nothing pretty spectacular is going on right now, because it's still the basics. I find it a little slow too right now, because I have a background in Python. This means the next 2-3 units will be pretty chill too. I guess it's just time to relax for now and pay attention to any tips, tricks, and shortcuts in the meantime.

### Day 18: September 20, 2018 - Thursday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple Javascript number guessing game with alerts, prompts, etc., and built a simple Javascript page that checks out properties about your age. Learned about Javascript logical operators and conditionals today.

**Thoughts**: I guess this is the day I remember how important it is to slow down and really listen even during the basics. This is because while I do have some solid knowledge on logical operators and conditionals in general already, Javascript has these special nuances (e.g. the use of "===", "==" being less strict, and truthy and falsy values). It was simple and fun today! Hopefully, the next few days will be a little more challenging.

### Day 19: September 21, 2018 - Friday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Javascript control flows today. Specifically, I got to learn the syntax for while loops in Javascript. Got to do a lot of exercises as well, solidifying my knowledge on logical operators, conditionals, and while loops.

**Thoughts**: Nothing logically challenging, as I've been through this via Python before, but it's still nice to get aclimated with a new language's way of doing things. I'm getting a little impatient, but it might simply be because of the lack of substantial and concrete output. Just gotta remind myself the fundamentals are just as important!

### Day 20: September 22, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 15 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the module on Javascript control flows with exercises on For Loops. Learned a lot about JS functions and did a couple of exercises on those too.

**Thoughts**: I got to learn a lot about the syntax for For Loops and Functions, which are honestly pretty similar across languages. Learned a couple of nuances about Javascript as well, like how functions called with incomplete parameters still run (empty parameters become equal to undefined).

### Day 21: September 23, 2018 - Sunday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the module on JS functions and started with the one on arrays. I built a simple to-do list app on the chrome browser. It's nothing fancy, but it's exciting to finally building something with some functionality.

**Thoughts**: It's always nice to learn slicing and indexing in languages. It's also very convenient that it is very similar with Python, which I have some level of mastery with. I think I'll be done with Javascript basics in about 2-3 more days. After that, I'll be studying DOM-related stuff, whatever that is.

### Day 22: September 24, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Learned about array iteration in Javascript, and found out about forEach, a method that's new to me. Using these, I upgraded my To Do List app for more functionality and readability.

**Thoughts**: Excited to finish up Javascript basics to be honest. It might be because of the lack of the satisfaction of completing a nice-looking project. But I guess I have to remind myself that I can't rush this. Things like forEach are what I wouldn't have learned if I didn't take things slow. The grind continues..

### Day 23: September 25, 2018 - Tuesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Did a problem set to summarize my understanding on Javascript arrays so far. Also learned a lot of background information about Javascript objects as well. I'll be finished with the Arrays unit and maybe half of the Objects unit by tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Today's exercises were challenging enough for me to learn and not be frustrated. Also, in terms of doing this challenge, today was the hardest to do, because we visited our boss in the morning in the hospital, because he got dengue over the weekend. I guess the best approach is to really wake up early for the purpose of completing the challenge first thing in the morning. I'll take that approach next time.

### Day 24: September 26, 2018 - Wednesday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the unit on JS Arrays by deconstructing and rebuilding the ForEach function. Also played with JSON structures by making my own movieDB for this Javascript Objects exercise Colt Steele gave. I'm really close to finishing the unit on JS Objects, so I'm pretty much done with Javascript Basics!

**Thoughts**: It was fun to play around with the JSON file type. I can finally tell myself that isn't a foreign word to me anymore. I'm also excited to move on to more backend related stuff tomorrow (I'm assuming DOM is part of backend).

### Day 25: September 27, 2018 - Thursday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished Javascript Basics and learned about objects and the "this" keyword. I'm finally in the DOM unit, so JS, CSS, and HTML are coming together! I made a basic html file that changes background color every second. 

**Thoughts**: So excited to finally make stuff again! DOM is basically the intersection of HTML, CSS, and JS, so thisi s basically what I've been waiting to do for so long! So hyped up!!

### Day 26: September 28, 2018 - Friday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 00 mins

**Today's Progress**: Not much coding today. Instead, I studied a lot of DOM selection and manipulation (specifically style and text manipulation).

**Thoughts**: Some things fascinated me, like how Javascript can toggle classes instead of individual styles on HTML tags, which adheres to the important concept of separation of concerns. I know I keep saying this, but it's getting really exciting! Can't wait to build my own website and another for my dad's company!

### Day 27: September 29, 2018 - Saturday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 10 mins

**Today's Progress**: Used Javascript to change Google's logo to Runescape's logo. Also redirected all links in the webpage to go to https://runescape.com. It's one of my favorite games! HAHA. Finished the module on DOM Manipulation and started with Advanced DOM Manipulation.

**Thoughts**: The module on DOM Manipulation really opened my eyes to the possibilities of web development and made it feel a little more feasible/doable for me. I'm really excited about the Advanced DOM Manipulation module as well, since we're already dealing with event listeners!

### Day 28: September 30, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to add event listeners to buttons so that users themselves can modify things dynamically on a webpage. I'm currently in the middle of completing a simple score keeper app, which I'm going to be finishing up tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I tried to do the code-along by myself first before watching the video, which significantly improve my learning speed. I'm going to do this more often moving forward.

### Day 29: October 01, 2018 - Monday

**Time Spent**: 1 hrs 05 mins

**Today's Progress**: Finished the module on advanced DOM manipulation with a couple of exercises: an interactive to-do list that has events happening upon hovering and clicking and a scorekeeper web app that can keep track of the scores of 2 players playing against each other in a turn-based manner.

**Thoughts**: I think the exercises to end the module were pretty solid! I feel very comfortable with what I know, and I think I can accomplish a lot with the skillset I have at this point. There is still SO MUCH to learn though. The grind continues.
